// The node_type_e enumeration defines the types of our AST nodes. For now, we only need two types. The first type represents the root node of a simple command's AST, while the second type represents the simple command's child nodes (which contain the command name and arguments). In the next parts of this tutorial, we'll add more node types to this enumeration.
enum node_type_e
{
    NODE_COMMAND,           /* simple command */
    NODE_VAR,               /* variable name (or simply, a word) */
};
// The val_type_e enumeration represents the types of values we can store in a given node structure. For simple commands, we'll only use strings (VAL_STR enumeration type). Later on in this series, we'll use the other types when we handle other types of complex commands.
enum val_type_e
{
    VAL_SINT = 1,       /* signed int */
    VAL_UINT,           /* unsigned int */
    VAL_SLLONG,         /* signed long long */
    VAL_ULLONG,         /* unsigned long long */
    VAL_FLOAT,          /* floating point */
    VAL_LDOUBLE,        /* long double */
    VAL_CHR,            /* char */
    VAL_STR,            /* str (char pointer) */
};
// The symval_u union represents the value we can store in a given node structure. Each node can have only one type of value, such as a character string or a numeric value. We access the node's value by referencing the appropriate union member (sint for signed long integers, str for strings, etc).
union symval_u
{
    long               sint;
    unsigned long      uint;
    long long          sllong;
    unsigned long long ullong;
    double             sfloat;
    long double        ldouble;
    char               chr;
    char              *str;
};
// The struct node_s structure represents an AST node. It contains fields that tell us about the node's type, the type of the node's value, as well as the value itself. If this is a root node, the children field contains the number of child nodes, and first_child points to the first child node (otherwise it will be NULL). If this is a child node, we can traverse the AST nodes by following the next_sibling and prev_sibling pointers.
struct node_s
{
    enum   node_type_e type;    /* type of this node */
    enum   val_type_e val_type; /* type of this node's val field */
    union  symval_u val;        /* value of this node */
    int    children;            /* number of child nodes */
    struct node_s *first_child; /* first child node */
    struct node_s *next_sibling, *prev_sibling;

                                 * if this is a child node, keep
                                 * pointers to prev/next siblings
                                 */
};
struct  node_s *new_node(enum node_type_e type);
void    add_child_node(struct node_s *parent, struct node_s *child);

/*
If we want to retrieve a nodeâ€™s value, we need to check the val_type field and, according to what we find there, access the appropriate member of the val field. For simple commands, all nodes will have the following attributes:

type => NODE_COMMAND (root node) or NODE_VAR (command name and arguments list)
val_type => VAL_STR
val.str => pointer to the string value
